# todo-list-app
A simple web-based To-Do List App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.   It allows users to add, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks.   The app uses local storage so tasks remain saved even after refreshing the page, and it is fully responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.
